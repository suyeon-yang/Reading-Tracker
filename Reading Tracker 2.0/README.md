# CP1404 Assignment 2: Reading Tracker 2.0 by Suyeon Yang

_Edit this README, replacing this line and above with your own assignment details._  
_At the end of the project, complete the project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the ... parts)._
_Note that to get high marks for this, your reflection should match the "exemplary" description from the rubric:_

> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
...  The assignment took me for at least 4 days when hours converted. It took quite longer than the first assignment but had a better output when compared.
I did not calculate the exact time taken, but I think it will be a great idea to do so in order to track the progress being made and to make comparisons with other tasks 
that may be done in the future and that has been done in the past.

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
... I am most satisfied with the fact that I have understood making functions even better and how it actually works. I still do not fully understand
the usage of classes in some aspects, but I am sure that it can be improved and can be used in developing more efficient and usable programs in the future. I am also satisfied for I got to
understand the 'way' of efficient programming, and that its output is necessary for further developments. 

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
... I am least satisfied with the building of GUI in which I still lack understanding regarding GUI interactions with classes. I am able to modify graphics and designs with ease,
but its dynamic properties are still hard and tricky to get into work. I hope to improve understanding how the whole process work for future projects and developments surely require
building of applications and programs that runs in a GUI rather than in a mere console.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
... The rewriting of the console program worked well and showed smooth progress for it was easier to use classes when building a program than having different functions
in a single file. Easy understanding and readability also made building of the program easier. I realized the importance of classes in programming, and that well-built
classes can make efficient programs. Furthermore, I started to appreciate OOP for it can be a base for plenty of developments too in different aspects.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
... I think the process of learning GUI could be done longer and study more about it in order to make the output better with excellence. A good building of GUI integrated with 
classes is a must to developers, and is necessary to build and enhance programming. On the other hand, trying to make the code even more efficient and readable should
still be improved and kept in mind as well. This time round I quite lack on time, so I am looking forward making another projects that can take longer time to complete for better output.

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
... I used the lecture notes, lecture recording, external videos, documentations, and previous practicals done. I used them to get ideas on what to make use in the function or method.
I also used them for better understanding of a certain method or function as well. These helped me in thinking more and in realizing that there are various ways to code and codes could be
enhanced and shortened by a single attribute or idea. It made me reflect that there are lots more to think of when creating programs and coding.


## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
... The main challenge was in building the actual class, for I still lacked the knowledge on how the whole class actually works. I overcame them with the resources mentioned above,
and also with constant trying of every method that I know and was learnt from the lectures. Critical thinking and logical thinking is said to be important in programming; however, I realized
that patience is also one of the most important aspects when it comes to it. Without patience, debugging and making of new functions and idea would be hard and
will not be achievable at all.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
... Classes made the program itself more efficient, and it helped me understand the whole program even better for its style of being object-oriented is more familiar to people. Building classes
are not that easy, but if it is made correctly once- then the rest will be a piece of cake. The idea of 'reusing' also stand as one of the advantage of classes,
for it can be used to make other various programs and applications as well not only limited to this project only. It enhanced the readability of my code and its 
'encapsulation' made the program look more simple and more readable. I look forward to study more about classes and make use of it
in further learning paths.
